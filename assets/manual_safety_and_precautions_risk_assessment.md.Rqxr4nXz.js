The safety of the robot installation depends on how the arm is integrated into the overall system, meaning a risk assessment cannot be done based on the robot alone.</p><p>To conduct a risk assessment for the robot, users who configure systems that include the robot must follow the guidelines of ISO 12100 and ISO 10218-2 when installing and operating the robot. Additionally, refer to technical standard ISO/TS 15066.</p><p>The risk assessment must be conducted immediately after the robotic arm is installed. The main focus of the risk assessment is to determine the safety configuration suitable for the surrounding environment and robot settings, as well as the need for additional emergency stop buttons and protective measures.</p><p>The safety-related functions of the collaborative robot can be configured in the safety configuration menu. The menu provides the following functions.</p><ul><li>I/O settings: The control box can be set to output safety information through the output terminal.</li><li>Speed control: Allows the user to control the moving speed of the robot arm.</li><li>Collision Detection Sensitivity Adjustment: When the robot collides with a nearby object, it will stop. However, the user can control the sensitivity at which the arm detects the collision.</li></ul><p>If the risks are not sufficiently reduced or eliminated by the above safety functions, additional protective measures should be installed to eliminate risks.</p><p>The manufacturer is not responsible for accidents that occur due to failure to follow international standards, domestic regulations, or failure to review the above risk assessment during installation.</p>',8),i=[a];function r(l,c,d,u,h,m){return s(),t("div",null,i)}const _=e(n,[["render",r]]);export{p as __pageData,_ as default};
