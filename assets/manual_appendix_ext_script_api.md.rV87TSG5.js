It can be used in conjunction with multiple RB series or other systems.<br> In conjunction with the vision system, movement coordinates can be changed in real time, or used as part of a user&#39;s existing system.</p><p>Users can control the robot with teaching pendant (tablet UI), but it provides a way to control the robot from any external controller for user’s convenience or operation.<br></p><p>The RB series receives script commands by default and executes those commands.<br> The task of writing a motion using the teaching pendant (tablet UI) and executing the script of the file in order is a general operation method. The following method described in this document is an alternative method of receiving a command script from another external device to control a robot of the RB series.</p><p>The control syntax provided in the teaching pendant/tablet UI can be implemented by the user directly from the external control device, and the robot operation commands/IO control commands are sent according to the user’s use case.</p><p>The following document describes an example of driving a robot with the above concepts.</p><h3 id="_2-external-control-script-api" tabindex="-1">2.

External Control Script API&quot;">​</a></h3><p>The description of the scripts provided in this document looks similar to the scripts in the “.wsl” work document, which is written using a tablet as a dedicated script for external control.<br> Work documents contain statements that control flows such as “repeat”, “if-else”, and “break”, so that the completion of a statement is not directly related to the action, and the parent sentence of that statement must be completed.</p><p>For example, suppose there are Point Functions in the Move command Function.</p><p>1 :</p><div class="language- vp-adaptive-theme"><button title="Copy Code" class="copy"></button><span class="lang"></span><pre class="shiki shiki-themes github-light github-dark vp-code"><code><span class="line"><span>move joint {</span></span>
