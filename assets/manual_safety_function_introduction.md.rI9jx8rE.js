The robot can be stopped in the designated stop mode even for movements above the physical limit, such as speed, momentum, etc. (See Section 3 of this chapter for the safety monitoring function). </li><li> System integrators and operators should consider the time and stopping distance between the robot stopping due to the operation of the error and safety monitoring functions described above. The system integrator must conduct a risk assessment considering the stopping distance and time (see Section 4 of this chapter). </li><li> System integrators and operators are aware of the fact that there is a safety monitoring function to limit the movement of the robot&#39;s joints and the robot/TCP, and must select the range of motion of the robot. TCP refers to the position to which the offset is added from the center point of the end of the robot arm. </li></ol></div><div class="danger custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">Danger</p><ol><li> The system integrator must conduct a risk assessment before applying power to the robot, and if it is used differently from that determined by the risk assessment or if different parameters are used, a risk that is not sufficiently reduced may occur. </li><li> When connecting additional safety devices, the power of both the robot and the control panel must be cut off. </li><li> When installing an additional safety device, measures must be taken to ensure that there is no problem when using it mechanically. For example, when using a light curtain, it must be firmly fixed to the floor/fixture, and movement and vibration must not occur during robot operation. </li><li> All safety function interfaces are set to 24V. Be careful when connecting devices with different voltages as it may cause equipment damage and fire. </li><li> The signal from the device mounted on the Tool Flange is not included in the safety function. Do not connect the safety device to the Tool Flange cable. </li></ol></div>',4),s=[a];function r(c,d,f,l,h,u){return o(),t("div",null,s)}const b=e(i,[["render",r]]);export{p as __pageData,b as default};
