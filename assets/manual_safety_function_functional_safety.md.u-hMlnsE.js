Power, that can cause rotation, is not applied to the motor. This safety sub-function corresponds to an uncontrolled stop in accordance with stop category 0 of IEC 60204-1.</li><li><strong>SS1(Safe Stop 1)</strong>: This function is specified as either<br> a) SS1-d (Safe-Stop 1 deceleration controlled) initiates and controls the motor deceleration rate within selected limits to stop the motor and performs the STO function when the motor speed is below a specified limit; or b) SS1-r (Safe-Stop 1 ramp monitored) initiates and monitors the motor deceleration rate within selected limits to stop the motor and performs the STO function when the motor speed is below a specified limit; or c) SS1-t (Safe Stop 1 time controlled) initiates the motor deceleration and performs the STO function after an application specific time delay. This safety sub-function corresponds to a controlled stop in accordance with stop category 1 of IEC 60204-1. Above three candidates, our system uses SS1-t.</li><li><strong>SS2(Safe Stop 2)</strong>: This function is specified as either SS2-d (Safe Stop 2 deceleration controlled) initiates and controls the motor deceleration rate within selected limits to stop the motor and performs the safe operating stop function when the motor speed is below a specified limit; or b) SS2-r (Safe Stop 2 ramp monitored) initiates and monitors the motor deceleration rate within selected limits to stop the motor and performs the safe operating stop function when the motor speed is below a specified limit; or c) SS2-t (Safe Stop 2 time con-trolled) initiates the motor deceleration and performs the safe operating stop function after an application specific time delay. This safety sub-function SS2 corresponds to a controlled stop in accordance with stop category 2 of IEC 60204-1. Above three candidates, our system uses SS2-t.</li><li><strong>SOS(Safe Operating Stop)</strong>: This function prevents the motor from deviating more than a defined amount from the stopped position. The PDS (SR) provides energy to the motor to enable it to resist external forces. This description of an operational stop function is based on implementation by means of a PDS (SR) without external (for example mechanical) brakes.</li><li><strong>SLP(Safely-Limited Position)</strong>: This function prevents the motor shaft (or mover, when a linear motor is used) from exceeding the specified position limit(s).</li><li><strong>SLS(Safely-Limited Speed)</strong>: This function prevents the motor from exceeding the specified speed limit.</li><li><strong>SLA(Safely-Limited Acceleration)</strong>: This function prevents the motor from exceeding the specified acceleration and/or deceleration limit.</li><li><strong>SLI(Safely-Limited Increment)</strong>: This function prevents the motor shaft from exceeding the specified limit of position increment within specified time.</li><li><strong>SLT(Safely-Limited Torque)</strong>: This function prevents the motor from exceeding the specified torque (or force, when a linear motor is used) limit.</li><li><strong>RPL(Robot Position Limit)</strong>: This function prevents the robot arm’s TCP (tool center point) or body frame exceeding the specified spatial region.</li><li><strong>TSL(TCP Speed Limit)</strong>: This function prevents the robot arm’s TCP speed exceeding the specified speed.</li><li><strong>CBPL(Control Box Power Limit)</strong>: This function prevents the Control Box’s power consumption exceeding the specified limit.</li><li><strong>EMS1(Emergency Stop1)</strong>: This function activates the stop mode when the emergency stop switch of the Teaching Pendant Unit is activated. The stop mode is the SF.2.</li><li><strong>EMS2(Emergency Stop2)</strong>: This function activates the stop mode when the special I/O ports of the Control Box are activated. Those ports are provided for users to connect their own switch devices. The stop mode is the SF.2.</li><li><strong>PRS(Protective Stop)</strong>: This function activates the stop mode when the special I/O ports of the Control Box are activated. Those ports are provided for users to connect their own protective devices. The stop mode is the SF.2.</li><li><strong>HSS(Hard Safeguard Stop)</strong>: This function activates the stop mode when the special I/O ports of the Control Box are activated. Those ports are provided for users to connect their own protective devices. The stop mode is the SF.1.</li><li><strong>SSS(Soft Safeguard Stop)</strong>: This function activates the stop mode when the special I/O ports of the Control Box are activated.
