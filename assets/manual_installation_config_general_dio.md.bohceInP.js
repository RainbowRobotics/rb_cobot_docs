To use other external equipment with the robot, connect the I/O from the robot control box with the corresponding equipment.<br> The universal digital I/O can be used to configure devices such as relays or PLC systems.<br> In this configuration, the output is always LOW unless the program is running. The following subsections are examples.</p><h3 id="_1-electric-load-control-with-digital-output" tabindex="-1">1.
