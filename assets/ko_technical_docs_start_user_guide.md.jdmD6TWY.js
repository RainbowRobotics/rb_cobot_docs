If you have long hair, take care not to get it caught in the robot&#39;s joints or other parts by tying it back.</li><li>Never use a damaged robot.</li><li>If a critical error occurs in the software, immediately activate emergency stop and contact the product supplier or Rainbow Robotics.</li><li>Check whether the values for robot installation angle, tool settings, safety instructions, etc., have been correctly entered.</li><li>Do not connect safety equipment to general I/O ports. Safety equipment should only be used with safety-related I/O ports.</li><li>Pay attention to the robot&#39;s movements when using a tablet PC for teaching.</li><li>Do not enter the robot&#39;s operating range while in use or touch the robot.</li><li>Never modify a robot. Rainbow Robotics (“manufacturer”) is not responsible for any issues arising from changes or modifications made arbitrarily by the user to the product.</li><li>The robot arm and controller generate heat when used for a long time. Do not touch the robot with your hands after using it for a long time. If you need to touch the robot, turn off the controller&#39;s power and wait for it to cool down sufficiently before handling it.</li><li>When the robot collides with an external object, a significant level of impact occurs in proportion to speed and payload.</li><li>Verify that you are using the recommended settings for the robot installation. If you do not accurately enter the direction of installation of the robot arm, weight of the tool, center of gravity, length, safety of the tool, etc., the direct teaching or collision detection function may not work properly.</li><li>The direct teaching function should be used in a safe environment. Do not use it if the tool or surrounding fixtures or parts have sharp edges or if they can cause pinching.</li><li>Before using the direct teaching function, make sure that all tool-related information (such as the tool&#39;s length, weight, and center of gravity) are accurately entered. Entering information different from the actual tool specifications can cause malfunctions when using the direct teaching function.</li><li>When using the direct teaching function, the joints may be emergency-stopped for the user&#39;s safety if operated above a certain speed.</li><li>The robot arm and control box generate heat during operation. Continuous contact with the robot arm can cause malfunctions, so do not handle or touch the robot arm with your hands during or immediately after the operation. Before manipulating or touching the robot arm, check the temperature on the UI screen or turn off the power of the robot arm and wait for more than one hour to allow it to cool sufficiently before handling.</li></ol></div><div class="warning custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">CAUTION</p><ol><li> When using the robot with machines or other robots that could potentially cause damage to the robot, we recommend testing all functions separately before use.
