Then, there are two options:<br> To stop the robot’s task and proceed with maintenance, press the Halt button to end the task.<br> To continue the robot&#39;s task, press the Resume button to resume the task.</p><p><strong>cf) TOK TOK</strong><br> When temporarily paused due to an external collision, lightly tapping the end of the robot arm twice will recover it from the paused state (same effect as pressing the Resume button).</p><h3 id="_2-self-collision" tabindex="-1">2.

Afterward, review the taught motion and the set work range.</p><p>If this occurs in Simulation mode on the Make screen, you can recover using the following methods:</p><ul><li>Use the motion-related buttons to recover the robot from a self-collision situation.</li><li>Temporarily switch to Real mode to receive actual joint information from the robot and recover.</li><li>Press the teaching button to receive actual joint information from the robot and recover.</li></ul><h3 id="_3-alarm-message" tabindex="-1">3.
